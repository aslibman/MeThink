Description:
Real Time Pictionary using Node.js. Uses socket.io and express to provide real time communication functionality. Multiple users will be able to join a game room and have the ability to draw on the canvas, while other players attempt to guess the depiction/word. A library of the game objects will be implemented in which users can add objects. Potential extensions to the application are that it can be used as a real time service in which users interact with each other on a communal canvas.

Timeline:

4/30 - Have accounts working.

5/4 - Have routing for various pages. Pretty-ify!

5/7 - Have two pages on the screen that are interactable. Give word to first player (and placeholder for second player).

5/10 - Have lobby on the dual-page screen that allows multiple people to connect.

5/13 - Working chat in lobby. If someone types answer in chat, end round.

5/15 - Keep track of score. When round ends, next person gets to draw.

--Other stuff, such as upgrades to profile to keep track of stats or even images--

--Additional features with enough time--
